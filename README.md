 Pulse width modulation is an effective technique that is used to control semiconductor devices. Pulse width modulation or PWM is a commonly used control technique that generates analog signals from digital devices such as microcontrollers. The signal thus produced will have a train of pulses, and these pulses will be in the form of square waves. Thus, at any given time, the wave will either be high or low.
 
 The output voltage of the PWM signal will be the percentage of the duty cycle. For example, for a 100% duty cycle, if the operating voltage is 5 V then the output voltage will also be 5 V. If the duty cycle is 50%, then the output voltage will be 2.5 V.â€‹
